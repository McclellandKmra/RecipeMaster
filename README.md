Recipe Master is a free application for people who like to cook! With Recipe Master you can create and save recipes for easy access on any device.

Development will slow down on this project, but I still plan to finish all of the intended features, including deploying this on a physical device.
# How to use Recipe Master:
## Account Creation
Creating an account is simple, all you need is an email and a password to get started.

## Viewing your Recipes
All of your recipes are visible on the home screen, 6 at a time. Use the navigation controls to view recipes not displayed on that page, or use the search bar to find specific ones.

## Recipe Search Bar
You can use a recipe's name, tags, or ingredients to filter specific recipes, making finding a specific recipe, or one that uses a specific ingredient a breeze!

## Recipe Creation
Pressing the plus button at top right of the recipes list will bring up the create recipes page. To create a recipe, choose an image from your device, and give the recipe a name. From there you can select any of your available tags, add ingredients and its amount, and create detailed steps to make following the recipe a breeze.

## Viewing a Recipe
Once you find a recipe on the home screen, tap it to bring up the full recipe details.

## Creating Tags
Create your own tags by navigating to the tags menu via the navigation bar on the side of your screen. Here, you can create a new tag, or delete any existing tags from your account.

## Favoriting Recipes
By favoriting a recipe, which is done by pressing the star at the top of the screen on the recipe details page, it can be viewed on the Favorite Recipes page. This page is accessed via the navigation bar on the side of your screen. Here, only recipes selected as favorites will be viewed.

## Account Management
To delete your account (currently the only account management feature), navigate to the account page via the navigation bar on the side of your screen. From here simply confirm your intention to delete the account. Upon account deletion, all associated recipes on your account will be deleted, regardless of favorite status.
